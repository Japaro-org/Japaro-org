# Japaro

**Japaro** is a personal, independent project created by [Shravan Bhati](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shravanbhati/). It serves as the parent identity under which multiple smaller projects are developed and maintained. Japaro was started with the goal of helping students and learners navigate their journey toward Japanâ€”whether through language study, scholarships, or general guidance.

This is not a company or government-affiliated body. It is a personal initiative driven by effort, experience, and commitment.

## ðŸ”¸ Why Japaro Exists

Japaro was created to make the student journey less confusing and more accessible. There's no agency behind this. No funding. No affiliate schemes. Just one person trying to build tools, write honest guides, and create useful resources from scratch.

We do not earn anything from these projects. All platforms under Japaro are free to use. But in the long run, running these platforms (server costs, research time, writing content, development) is not sustainable without support. Thatâ€™s why we may release some paid resources in the futureâ€”strictly to keep things running.
